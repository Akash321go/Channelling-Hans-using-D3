This is a visualisation created using D3 which replicates Hans Rosling's famous bubble graph visualisation. Hans Rosling is a data visualisation legend. His 2006 TED talk, The Best Stats Youâ€™ve Ever Seen, is one of the most viewed videos on the TED website (http://bit.ly/2doLzAY). Here is a link to my live visualisation. https://akash321go.github.io/Channelling-Hans-using-D3/
